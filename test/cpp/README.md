# Testing C++ SLAM core 

Check and run the tests in `pyslam/slam/cpp/test_cpp` and `pyslam/slam/cpp/test_py`. In particular, for a quick check run the scripts:
- `pyslam/slam/cpp/test_cpp/run_all_tests.sh`
- `pyslam/slam/cpp/tests_py/run_all_tests.sh`

See this [README](../../pyslam/slam/cpp/README.md) file for further details.
